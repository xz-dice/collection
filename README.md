## **About Xandy 500**

Xandy 500 is a collection app that displays an (unranked) definitive list of 500 of my all-time favourite songs, with Spotify links, album artwork, and song previews when the album artwork is selected.

A functional PHP application that displays song data from a DB.

## **Installation**

To install, clone this repo, install the sql file into a DB named xandy-collection and configure your database connection in includes/db.php.
